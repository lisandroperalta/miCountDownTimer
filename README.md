# miCountDownTimer
Simple countdown timer to seteable date and hour with spout output

Great for countdown timers like new years eve.
It simply spouts out the time remaining to a certain date. (keep in mind that didint fixed it to when its further than 24 hours)
Will probably improve it in the future.

Feel free to use the app or the .VL source as you wish (just tag me from time to time!)
